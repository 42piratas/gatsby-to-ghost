A delegation of the AKASHA team gathered in Geneva mid-February to meet with the group from CERN's [Idea Square](http://ideasquare.web.cern.ch/).

[CERN](https://home.cern/) is the European Organization for Nuclear Research that operates the world's largest particle physics laboratory near Geneva, Switzerland.

The mission of Idea Square resonates very well with the goals of the AKASHA Foundation:

> Connecting curious minds to accelerate ideas through collaboration, R&D prototyping, and experimental innovation.

It also relates to the very first post on the AKASHA blog ["Unveiling AKASHA"](https://akasha.org/blog/2016/05/03/unveiling-akasha).

We're continuously scouting for use cases that we believe can benefit from the transformational potential of blockchain-type technologies to solve some of the biggest challenges we face as a civilization, specifically when setting out to encourage the emergence of collective intelligence.

We give the global sharing of information relating to science, innovation and knowledge creation a high priority. Society needs to be able to source from an unbiased, readily and comprehensively-accessible, open repository of all human knowledge.

Such resource does not yet exist. It's not even clear how this may be achieved. And yet CERN has a track record ... it's where Sir Tim Berners-Lee and a team of engineers knew they were onto something big when they [created](https://home.cern/science/computing/where-web-was-born) the World Wide Web in 1989.

Take a look at [the first websites that emerged at CERN between 1990 and 1992](http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/DataSources/bySubject/Overview.html) and see for yourself which use cases were initially considered and tested. We're still grappling with many of the ideas of the early days, including the concept of a "personal homepage" as this nice [clip](https://youtu.be/_uG-Q1pWqBc) points out.

Re-establishing privacy and agency on the Web ‚Äî let's call it the "post-Facebook" era ‚Äî should help us to re-align with the vision of the Web's founders and create a resource that harnesses the collective intelligence of humanity to address our largest challenges.

In the coming months, we'll reveal more details about our joint vision with the CERN group. For now, we can share some impressions of this event and also use this opportunity to express again our gratitude to the CERN team including Oday Darwich, Pablo Garcia-Tello, Markus Nordberg, and Romain Mueller that hosted us on this truly epic day! üëèüëèüëè
